## Description of Project
Our project 3 will focus on Breast Cancer data analysis
We will be continuing with our data set from project one and performing a data visualization
Our data set will come from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) breast cancer and racial disparities outcomes study
It consists of demographic data for patients with Breast Cancer and COVID-19 and provides information on their COVID-19 outcomes
