# Breast Cancer Research Group

## Description of Project
Our project 3 will focus on Breast Cancer data analysis. We will be continuing with our data set from project one and performing a data visualization. Our data set will come from the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) breast cancer and racial disparities outcomes study. It consists of demographic data for patients with Breast Cancer and COVID-19 and provides information on their COVID-19 outcomes.

## Questions we are asking of the data:

What are the sociodemographic and clinical factors that influence adverse outcomes: 
1. How does the timing and type of their breast cancer treatment affect their COVID-19 outcomes? - Alex
2. Is smoking a factor in severe COVID-19 for individuals with Breast Cancer? - Mina
3. Amongst all the races with different BC statuses, is smoking a factor for them to have COVID-19? - Mina
4. How does race/ethnicity affect COVID with Breast Cancer? - Shan
5. Does obesity and age have an effect on COVID-19 with Breast Cancer? - Fozia
6. Is the severity of COVID-19 affected if the individuals live in urban, suburban, or rural areas? - Hamza
7. What is the isolated effect of age on the risk of COVID-19 and Breast Cancer outcomes? - Dean
