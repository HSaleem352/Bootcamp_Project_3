        <p>Welcome to our webpage, where we delve into a comprehensive analysis rooted in a collaborative study with the COVID-19 and Cancer Consortium (CCC19) registry. Our research focuses on the intersection of COVID-19 and breast cancer (BC) in females, spanning from March 2020 to June 2021. The study involves 1383 female participants diagnosed with breast cancer and confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, with a median age of 61 years and a follow-up period of 90 days. To ensure diversity, participants hail from various geographic regions within the United States.</p>
        <p>Our primary goal is to thoroughly examine the severity of COVID-19 outcomes among females with a history of breast cancer. Utilizing the CCC19 registry, we aim to pinpoint specific factors influencing COVID-19 severity in this unique population. This valuable knowledge is essential for tailoring medical responses and interventions for individuals with breast cancer who contract COVID-19. Explore our findings and insights as we contribute to the understanding of this critical intersection between breast cancer and the ongoing pandemic.</p>
