  <div class="intro">
    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>Research has found that ACT can compromise an individual’s immune system by either reducing the availability of white blood cells or changing the immune system’s ability to respond to infection. Patients in our study cohort received  different types of ACT at various time points relative to their Covid infection that range from no treatment to targeted immuno therapy. Thus, each unique cancer treatment likely interacted with the patient's immune system differently, and affected their ability to respond to viral infections like Covid-19. The study collected data on when patients received anti-cancer treatment relative to when they got covid, and the type of treatment they received. So, we want to investigate the effect that ACT has on a patient's immune system by examining how the <a href="#section1">Timing</a> and <a href="#section2">Treatment Type</a> of ACT affected the patients overall Covid outcome.</p>
    <p>For each study question below, you will find a general bar graph that displays the cumulative data and additional pie charts that provide a broken-down view of the overall data. Clicking on the bar graph will provide you with more information on the hypothesis and the data analysis that was performed. The pie charts are bundled in a carousel and organized by Covid outcome severity.</p>

      <p style = "max-width: 80%;">I am hypothesizing that the closer in time the cancer treatment was given to a patient's COVID-19 infection, the more likely the patient will experience moderate or severe COVID-19 outcomes. The cancer treatment would compromise their immune system, thus making it harder for patients to fight off the infection and lead to more severe outcomes.</p>

          <p style="max-width: 60%;"> I hypothesized that individuals who received ACT closer to their timing of having covid would have more severe covid outcomes than individuals who never received ACT or who received it more than 3 months after getting covid. The null hypothesis would be that the timing had no effect on an individual’s covid-19 outcome severity. A chi-squared analysis shows that there was no significant relationship between the covid-19 outcome and the timing of ACT. For each group, the calculated p-value was larger than 0.05, which means that we fail to reject the null hypothesis. In this dataset, it seems that there was no significant relationship between the covid-19 outcome and the timing of ACT</p>

A chi-squared analysis shows that there was no significant relationship between the covid-19 outcome and the type of ACT as each outcome group had a p value greater than 0.05.

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>
    <p>Despite current research, it seems that the type and timing of ACT had no effect on the severity of Covid outcomes. Further research would have to be conducted to better elucidate if and how anti-cancer treatment can interact with the immune system and affect its ability to fight viral infections  </p>
